         <h2> <center> A Brief History of Wind Energy </center> </h2>
         <p style="margin-left: 25px; text-indent: 25px;"> Wind has been used as energy in some form or another for thousands of years. The first windmills were built in the 1180s in Northwestern Europe,
         which was the first iteration of what would eventually become the wind turbine. In the 1850s, the first wind engine was built in Illinois, and in
         1883, the first wind generator was installed. The first ever wind farm was built in New Hampshire in 1980 by the company U.S. Windpower. In 1991, the
         first ever offshore wind farm was built off the coast of Denmark. The most powerful wind farm ever up until that point, it was able to cover the annual
         consumption of 2,200 households. Today, 434 billion kilowatthours is produced by wind farms every year in the U.S. alone. </p>
         <h2> <center> The First Offshore Wind Farm </center> </h2>
         <p style="margin-left: 25px; text-indent: 25px;"> The Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm was the first offshore wind farm. Constructed in 1991 off the coast
         of the island of Lolland in Denmark, it remained active until 2017, lasting a solid 25 years. Leading up to the opening of the Vindeby Wind Farm, many
         people did not believe that it was possible to operate such a large wind farm in the sea. However, this farm proved to be very effective, hence why
         it was used for so long. </p>
         <h2> <center> Further Growth and Advancements </center> </h2>
         <p style="margin-left: 25px; text-indent: 25px;"> Over the next two decades, the technology continued to improve and offshore wind farms got larger
         and larger. In 2000, most offshore wind turbines had a rotor diameter of only 80 meters. By 2015, that increased to 160, and in 2020 most rotor diameters
         were well over 220 meters. Additionally, windfarms are much larger than they were in the 90s, and wind turbines are significantly more reliable. </p>

    <h3> <center> How does it work? </center> </h3>
    <p> <center> The wind turbines are secured by foundations on the ocean floor. When the wind's energy is captured and turned into electricity, it is
    transferred to an offshore substation through cables. From there, it is sent to an onshore substation before being transferred to the transmission
    network. </center> </p>
    <h3> <center> Leaders in Offshore Wind Power </center> </h3>
    <p> <center> China is the leading nation in both onshore and offshore wind power, with Germany and the United Kingdom close behind. </center> </p>
    <h3> <center> Energy Generated </center> </h3>
    <p> <center> Today, the average offshore wind turbine produces 3.6 megawatts. </center> </p>

    <h3> <center> What is it? </center> </h3>
    <p> <center> Offshore wind farms are farms that generate energy from the strong winds out at sea by turning it into electricity. </center> </p>
    <h3> <center> The Largest Offshore Wind Farm </center> </h3>
    <p> <center> Currently, Hornsea 2 is the largest wind farm in the world. However, when it is complete, the Dogger Bank wind farm will become the
    largest.</center> </p>
    <h3> <center> Who invented it? </center> </h3>
    <p> <center> Bill Heronemus is largely credited with coming up with much of the foundation for offshore wind power. Known as the "father of modern
    windpower", Heronemus invented wind turbine arrays and many ideas associated with offshore windfarms. In fact, he is credited with coining the term
    "windfarm".
